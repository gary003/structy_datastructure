# Structy Algorithm Exercises

## Overview
Welcome to my Structy Algorithm Exercises repository! This project showcases my expertise in solving algorithmic challenges using JavaScript and TypeScript. It includes solutions to a wide range of problems from Structy, covering dynamic programming, graphs, linked lists, stacks, and more. Each solution is optimized for performance, thoroughly tested with diverse inputs, and clearly documented for readability.

## Features
- **Broad Coverage**: Solutions for 20+ Structy problems, including `fib`, `countPaths`, `quickestConcat`, and `maxPathSum`.
- **Optimized Code**: Uses techniques like memoization (e.g., `tribonacci`), dynamic programming (e.g., `countingChange`), and space-efficient iteration.
- **Test Cases**: Each solution includes multiple test cases to ensure correctness (e.g., edge cases like empty grids in `arrayStepper`).
- **Clear Structure**: Organized by problem category (e.g., DP, graphs) with inline comments explaining the logic.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
 
   - `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/structy-exercises.git`
   - `cd structy-exercises`

## Start

- You can then launch each exercise you want with the node command
    ex: `node 2.arrayAndString/fiveSort.js`
